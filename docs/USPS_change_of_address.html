<h1>About the data</h1>
<p>This dataset is provided by the authors of the following report;</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Changes to Rural Migraiton in the COVID-19 Pandemic” Petersen, Julia K., Richelle L. Winkler, and Miranda H. Mockrin. “Changes to Rural Migration in the COVID‐19 Pandemic.” Rural Sociology, 2024. https://doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12530.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The data provided by the authors relies on the U.S. Postal Service change-of-address data to describe whether and how established domestic migration systems changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>From the report;</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Beginning in March 2021, monthly change-of-address data dating back to April 2017 were made publicly abailable. These data show the number of change-of-address forms filed that indicate temporary and permanent relocation into (inflows) and out-of (outflows) ZIP codes by month. - Petersen, Julia K., Richelle L. Winkler, and Miranda H. Mockrin. “Changes to Rural Migration in the COVID‐19 Pandemic.” Rural Sociology, 2024. https://doi.org/10.1111/ruso.1253</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the way these forms are process, a number of assumpptions were made.</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual forms represent one migrant.</li>
<li>Each family form represents 3.14 individuals.</li>
<li>They excluded temporary change-of-addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The USPS suppresses monthly data for ZIP codes where fewer than 11 change-of-address forms are filed in that month. The authors conudcted consitional mean imputation for each county-month missing inflow and/or outflow values. To do this, they would use the monthly average conditional on when the missing value was;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mean value for pre-prandemic (April 2017 - March 2020),</li>
<li>Mean value post-pandemic onset (April 2020 - March 2023).</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<section id="data-limitations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-limitations">Data limitations</h2>
<p>The data will undercount the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>young children</li>
<li>undocumented immigrants</li>
<li>young adults leaving their parental home.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dataset includes households that file a change-of-address within a county. “This means measures of in-migration and out-migration shown in this paper will includes moves within the county as well as moves between counties.” However, the net migration measures will be better indicators of the net balance of inter-counter migration since they will cancel each other out.</p>

<p>The most useful data here will be the in-, out-, and net-migration rates because we will be able to compare the impacts across rural and urban without sheer population size of urban areas dwarfing all other geographies.</p>
<p>The authors calculated the rate using the following formula (I’ll use the net migration for the example);</p>
<ul>
<li>(NetMig_countyYYYYMM_IMP / PopbyMonth) * 10,000</li>
</ul>
<p>In this formula, each value is defined as;</p>
<ul>
<li>NetMig_countyYYYYMM_IMP = InMig_countyYYYYMM_IMP - OutMig_countyYYYYMM_IMP
<ul>
<li>Each of these are calculated using the U.S. Postal Service by-month change-of-address zip code data. The computational means have already been calculated for missing/suppressed data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>PopbyMonth = Population data from U.S. Census Bureau Population Estimates Program. This data is for July 1 for each calendar year. The authors use this value for their July inputs, and than use linear interpolation to estimate the August - June populations. For the monthly estimates following July 2022, the authors used each county’s median rate of annual population change from 2017 to 2022.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Change in migration</h1>
<p>First, let’s look at overall changes in net migration. Once we determine what these trends are, we can explore further and see if the net changes are caused by changes to inflow or outflows.</p>
<p>We will explore net migration by the following geographies and county types;</p>
<ul>
<li>Minnesota</li>
<li>Planning Region</li>
<li>County</li>
<li>RUCA</li>
<li>REC_2015</li>

<p>Below are the annual net migration numbers using this data. Interestingly, it shows that Minnesota as a whole has experienced a net out-migration every year. When breaking it down, this continues to be the case for every region and RUCA group. However, the out-migration lessened for more rural areas during the pandemic compared to more urban areas.</p>

<p>As we get into smaller geographies, we begin to see some interesting patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Northwest</strong> All EDRs saw significant improvement from their net out migration in 2017. EDR 5 actually experienced a net in-migration for a few years before falling back to net out-migration.</p>
<p><strong>Northeast</strong> The arrowhead has seen improvement in their net out-migration during and after their pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Central</strong> There is improvement among all EDRs in their net-out migration numbers. EDR 7E actually experienced a net in-migration during the pandemic and continues to be breaking even.</p>
<p><strong>Seven County Metro</strong> The seven county metro continues a slide in their net out-migration with slight improvement over the last few years.</p>
<p><strong>Southwest</strong> Southwest hasn’t seen a whole love of change except for EDR 9 which experienced a huge drop off.</p>
<p><strong>Southeast</strong> A bit of a roller coaster for Southeast with big improvement in out-migration followed by a steep worsening. In the last year they are right back where they started.</p>

<h1>Out vs.&nbsp;In migration</h1>
<p>So what drove this change across Minnesota? Was it that people stopped moving in to places with worsening net migration numbers? Or, was it that more people left those places? Let’s take a look.</p>

<p>The charts below compare the in migration and out migration over two time periods;</p>
<ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="minnesota-2">Minnesota</h3>
<p>After the pandemic there was a reduction in out flow and in flow migration across Minnesota. However, the reduction in in-flow was more severe, translating in a worse net outmigration rate. The number of people migrating in to Minnesota after the pandemic reduced by -184, whereas the number of people flowing out of Minnesota reduced by -175.</p>

<p>Every single region had worse in flow and improved out flow after the pandemic. However, in Greater Minnesota, with the exception of southwest, the improvement in outflow drove the improvement in net migration. For Southwest and the Seven County Mple St.&nbsp;Paul, the significant drop in inflows drove a worsening net out migration.</p>

<p>For most of Greater Minnesota, there were significant improvements in net migration. All of Northwest had significantly less out flow. That region had some of the largest improvements. Also interesting is Southwest. Although as a region they were an outlier in terms of net migration, it was only due to EDR 9. They had a significant decline in in flow while EDR 6W and 8 experienced significantly larger declines in out flows.</p>

<p>The maps below clearly show that most of Greater Minnesota experienced an improved net migration value while metropolitan areas, and counties with major Universities experienced a worse net migration value after the pandemic.</p>
<p>Also interesting is that nearly all counties that experienced improved net migration values was largely driven by large changes in outflows - essentially, these counties experienced less out migration than before the pandemic.</p>
<p>The opposite is true for urban areas where nearly all counties that experienced a worse net migration value was due to significantly lower inflows than before the pandemic.</p>
<p>There are a couple of exceptions to these trends.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Improved net migration due to larger inflows</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Red Lake County</li>
<li>Traverse</li>
<li>Pipestone</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="counties---improved-or-worsened-inflows-and-outflows">Counties - improved or worsened inflows and outflows</h2>
<p>I want to see what the maps look like in terms of which counties had better inflows vs outflows.</p>
<p>The map below shows 2 major themes;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Nearly all counties had worse inflows after the pandemic compared to before.</li>
<li>Nearly all counties had better outflows after the pandemic compare to before.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a couple of exceptions;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Red Lake County - better inflow rate of 31 people per 10,000.</li>
<li>Traverse County - better inflow rate of 251 people per 10,000</li>
<li>Pipestone county - better inflow rate of 248 people per 10,000</li>
</ol>
<p>The map also shows that there are three counties with worse outflows.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Red Lake county - worse outflow rate of 11 more people per 10,000</li>
<li>Traverse County - worse outflow rate of 170 more people per 10,000</li>
<li>Blue Earth County - worse outflow rate of 509 more people per 10,000</li>
</ol>
<p>One other interesting thing to note. Whether a county had better or worse for these flows did not predict whether net migration rates would be better or worse. So even if a county had better outflow rates, it didn’t predict whether that county would than have a better net migration rate.</p>
