    "text": "I emailed Stephan Whitaker to see if he could provide me the dataset highlighting the flows and he was unable to. But he did send me the following instructions on how to use the IPUMS dataset that might help highlight the trend.\nUnfortunately, I didn’t get permission to release the gross flows. If I was going to try to make those myself with public data, I would take these steps:\n\nDownload 5 or 10 years of ACS microdata from IPUMS. Select the migration variable, year, PUMAs, MIGPUMAs and person weights.\nDrop everyone who hasn’t moved in the last year based on the value in the migration variable.\nMerge on lists of PUMAs and MIGPUMAs in the Minneapolis MSA.\nDrop any mover who has both a Minneapolis MIGPUMA and a Minneapolis PUMA (those are local moves you’re not interested in).\nSum up the person weights within each year for movers with a Minneapolis MIGPUMA. That’s an annual estimate of out-migration from the metro.\nSum up the person weights within each year for movers with a Minneapolis PUMA. That’s the annual estimate of in-migrants.\n\nSo, that’s what I’m going to do here.\nFirst, let’s import the dataset.\nThis is a massive dataset. It contains rows with the following variables;\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nYEAR\n\n\nSTATEFIP\n\n\nPUMA\n\n\nPERNUM\n\n\nPERWT\n\n\nMIGRATE1\n\n\nMIGRATE1D\n\n\nMIGPLAC1\n\n\nMIGPUMA1\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the definitions of those variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nYEAR\nCensus year\n\n\nSTATEFIP\nState (FIPS Code)\n\n\nPUMA\nPublic Use Microdata Area\n\n\nPERNUM\nPerson number in sample unit\n\n\nPERWT\nPerson weight\n\n\nMIGRATE1\nMigration status 1 year - general version\n\n\nMIGRATE1D\nMigration status 1 year - detailed version\n\n\nMIGPLAC1\nState or country of residence 1 year ago\n\n\nMIGPUMA1\nPUMA of resident 1 year ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple steps I’m taking here.\n\nRemove non-movers: Remove individuals that have not moved at all or are unknown.\nCategorize PUMAs and MIGPUMAs into logical taxonomies;\n\nMetro vs Greater MN: this just aggregates all PUMA and MIGPUMA into whether they are in the seven county metro vs. the rest of Minnesota.\nMetro vs. Refined Greater MN: this will aggregate PUMAs into a seven county metro category and aggregate the other PUMAs into something that mimics the plannig regions of Minensota - NW, NE, Central, SW, SE PUMAS.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we need to get rid of anyone that hasn’t moved at all for each census year. We will use the MIGRATE1 variable which has the following codes;\n\n0 - N/A\n1 - Same house a year ago\n2 - Moved within state since a year ago\n3 - Moved between states since a year ago\n4 - Abroad one year ago\n9 - Unknown\n\nSo, let’s filter out everyone that is either 0, 1, or 9. In order to decrease the size of the file, I have already filtered these out when I submitted my request for the data. So my dataset doesn’t have any individuals that were categorized as such.\n\n\n\n\nThe two primary variables IPUMS uses to track inflow and outflow of migration is PUMA and MIGPUMA. PUMA identifies the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) where the housing unit was located. PUMAs are the smallest geographic units identified in Public Use Microdata Samples since 1990 for both the decennial censuses and the ACS/PRCS. To help maintain the confidentiality of respondents in public use microdata, every PUMA must, by design, have at least 100,000 residents at the time of the corresponding census.\n\nNote: PUMA codes are state-dependent. The PUMA codes for 1990 and later samples are unique only within each state, so a single code may identify different PUMAs in different states. To uniquely identify all PUMAs, it is necessary to combine the PUMA variable with a state identifier (STATEFIP or STATEICP). The IPUMS-defined 1960 PUMA codes are unique across all states and do not have this requirement.\nThe definitions of Migration Public Use Microdata Areas (Migration PUMAs) are used in ACS and PRCS samples to identify where respondents moved from. See the MIGPUMA1 variable description for more information.\n\nHere are the codes that represent the PUMAs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here are the migration puma codes that cross reference the PUMA codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the PUMA and MIGPUMA codes from 2010 to 2021 don’t compare nicely to 2022.\nThe maps below provide the PUMA and migration PUMA boundaries from 2010 to 2021 and than 2022’s version. We notice that the migraiton PUMAs fit into each or within multiple PUMA boundaries for each of the year breakdowns. So there is no problem compaing PUMA and migration PUMA.\nUnfortunately, the PUMA boundaries change too much in order to compare the 2010-2021 PUMA with the 2022 PUMA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall that means we need to create categories that align all the way across. It will be very difficult to do by geography. For example, if we try to combine PUMAs to create a Northwest region, there is no way to create a Northwest region from 2010-2021 PUMA to 2022 PUMA. They don’t match. If we want to see trends in migration flow by geography we will have to keep 2010-2021 data separate from 2022. That won’t be a problem and will still be interesting.\nNow we can aggregate these areas into larger geographies so it’s easier to analyze. There are fewer migration PUMAs and so if we aggregate some of those then it will be easier to have the PUMAs follow.\nThe hope is that we can kind of keep the larger cities in each aggregate PUMA between the 2010-2021 definitions and the 2022 definition. For example, making sure Mankato is in the same region in the 2010-2021 taxonomy as the 2022 taxonomy, even when the PUMA area it’s located is changes.\nMIGPUMA\n\n2010-2021\n\nNorthwest: 100, 200, 800\nNortheast: 390\nCentral: 700, 600, 1900\nSt. Cloud: 900, 1800, 1000\nSouthwest: 2000, 2100, 2200\nSoutheast: 2400, 2300, 2500, 2600\nRochester: 02500\n\n2022\n\nNorthwest: 190, 700,\nNortheast: 390\nCentral: 600, 1200, 2100\nSt. Cloud: 990\nSouthwest: 800, 2200, 2300, 2400,\nSoutheast: 2500, 2600, 2800, 2700\nRochester: 2700\n\n\nThe maps below are the PUMA and MIGPUMA boundaries for 2010 - 2021 and 2022 along with the geographic taxonomy. They match, so we are all good to go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other way of breaking this down is to categorize the state into two categories;\n\nGreater Minnesota (all regions not labeled seven county metro), and\nSeven county metro.\n\nThe maps below show what that looks like in correspondence with the new migration PUMAs. It does highlight that we can combine the 2022 data with the 2010 through 2021 data since they are the same areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charts below provide the flows for each year starting in 2013.\nGreater MN vs. Metro\nWhat we see here is Greater MN experiencing an increasing inflow and a decreasing outflow by 2017, and then a reversal before 2020, and since the pandemic another turnaround with Greater Minnesota having an increasing inflow and decreasing outflow.\nIn the seven county metro we see the opposite - they were having a larger inflow than outflow from 2013 to about 2017, and then it flipped and then the pandemic hit and there was a significant drop in inflows and a large increase in outflows.\nRegional\n\nNorthwest: Northwest has been basically breaking even with a very modest net in migration since the early 2010s.

The more rural county groups tend to lose a lot of their 20 to 29 year olds. Over ten years, these counties lose nearly 20% to 40% of their 10 to 19 year olds. However, that has lessened a bit from 2010 to 2020. Interestingly, these counties tend to see more 30 to 49 year olds than expected. Over ten years, these counties see 25% to 5% more than the previous ten years for each younger age group. However, this has lessened quite a bit compared to 1990 to 2000.\nOur more urban areas tend to have the exact opposite pattern. They tend to see a large in-migration of people age 20 to 29, but out migration of folks older than 40. However, this has lessened from 2010 to 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is fascinating. Recreational counties that are entirely rural or town/rural mix have a significantly higher percentage of people that are 30 or older move into those counties compared to non-recreational. In addition, the in-migration goes further up the age groups as well. Urban/town/rural mix counties do not have that same pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that all patterns are becoming less robust.\nNorthwest\nFollows a rural pattern but has pretty robust in-migration in the older age cohorts.\nNortheast\nFollows a rural pattern but really struggles with the older age cohorts.\nCentral\nFollows a rural pattern with very robust in-migration of older age cohorts.\nMetro\nFollows a urban pattern but also sees nice growth in 10-20 year olds.\nSouthwest\nFollows a rural pattern. Interestingly, from 2010 to 2020, it has experienced a significant percentage increase in in-migration of 20-24 year olds. That’s unexpected.\nSoutheast\nFollows a rural pattern but struggle with the older age cohorts. Also has seen an increase in 20-24 year olds like Southwest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDR 1, 2, 4, 5\nEDR 1 follows a rural pattern but really struggles with older age cohorts.\nEDR 2, 4, 5 has a strong in-migration among older age cohorts.\nEDR 6E, 7E, 7W\nEDR 6E struggles with older age cohorts.\nEDR 7E and 7W do well with older age cohorts.\nEDR 6W, 8, 9\nAll struggle with older age cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne key theme here is that all patterns are becoming less robust.\nRural counties tend to do well from 10 to 14 but gradually lost people as the approach 20. And then really do bad between 20 and 29.\nRural counties do a lot better when people turn 30. They begin to do worse as they approach 45.\nJust as expected, retirees consolidate to north central Minnesota.\nWeird to see how much less robust this all is though.\n\n10-1415-1920-2425-2930-3435-3940-4445-4950-5455-5960-6465-69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated age groups\nLet’s consolidate the age groups as follows;\n\n10-14\n20-29\n30-44\n45-59\n60 and older\n\nThe maps show a couple of clear trends.\n\nAll patterns are becoming less robust.\nRural counties tend to see an in-migration of 30 to 44 year olds along with their 10-14 year old children.\nCentral lakes of Minnesota tend to see an in-migration of 45 and older while all other regions experience a net out-migration.\n\n\n10-1420-2930-4445-5960-69"

    "text": "The following is an analysis of the components of change for Minnesota counties. The data is from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Population Estimates.\nEach year, the United States Census Bureau produces and publishes estimates of the population for the nation, states, metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, counties, state/county equivalents, and Puerto Rico. We estimate the resident population for each year since the most recent decennial census by using measures of population change. The resident population includes all people currently residing in the United States.\nWith each annual release of population estimates, the Population Estimates Program revises and updates the entire time series of estimates from April 1, 2020 to July 1 of the current year, which we refer to as the vintage year. We use the term “vintage” to denote an entire time series created with a consistent population starting point and methodology. The release of a new vintage of estimates supersedes any previous series and incorporates the most up-to-date input data and methodological improvements.\nThe population estimates are used for federal funding allocations, as controls for major surveys including the Current Population Survey and the American Community Survey (ACS), for community development, to aid business planning, and as denominators for statistical rates, among many other uses. Overall, the estimates time series from 2010 to 2020 was very accurate, even accounting for ten years of population change. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE), which is the average absolute difference between the final total resident population estimates and 2020 Census counts, was only about 2.9 percent across all counties.\nWe produce estimates using a cohort-component method, which is derived from the demographic balancing equation:\nPopulation base + Births - Deaths + Migration = Population estimate\nVital Statistics\nVital statistics encompass two of the core components of the demographic equation: births and deaths. We receive data on vital records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and, until V2024, the FSCPE. NCHS data are derived from birth and death certificates across the United States. Birth data include date of birth, sex of child, residence of mother, and race and Hispanic origin of both mother and father. Death data include residence, age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin of each decedent, and the date each death occurred.\nNet Domestic Migration\nThe third major component of the balancing equation is migration. Migration can be divided into net domestic migration (NDM) within the United States and net international migration (NIM) between the United States and elsewhere. The Population Estimates Program calculates domestic migration using several data sources and methods depending on the age group in question and the level of characteristic detail required.\nFor state and county total estimates, we calculate county-specific net domestic migration based on four data sources:\nTo understand how each component is, and has, contributed to population change, we will split up the components in order to fully explore their contribution."

    "text": "Trends\nThe following charts provide the change in population from 2000 to 2023.\nAlthough the state has grown in population by 16.3% since 2000, that growth hasn’t been even across the state, nor has it been even across rurality. Our most rural counties of Minnesota that are not categorized as “recreational” have experienced a population loss of 13.2% whereas entirely rural counties that are “recreational” have experienced a population increase of 2.4%.\nIn addition, town/rural mix counties that are recreational have experienced an increase of 12.4% in population compared to a loss of 1.4%.\nEssentially, our most rural, non-recreational counties have experienced population loss.\nWhen looking at the planning region level, all regions have experienced positive population growth, but within those regions that isn’t the case. There is population losses concentrated in counties located in Southwest Minnesota, and along the very northwest board of Minnesota.\n\n\nMinnesotaRUCACounty recreationalPlanning RegionEDRCounty\n\n\nSince 2000, the Minnesota population has increased pretty consistently. By 2023, the population was 16% higher than in 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two points here.\nFirst, population growth is occurring in all RUCA categories except Entirely rural. The more urban a county is, the larger the increase in population since 2000.\nSecond, the Census Bureau continues to underestimate the population performance of rural county groups. This is why there are consistent increases/up-adjusting in population change at the 2011 and 2021 values. The 2010 and 2020 populations are estimates and when they begin the new population estimates for the new decade, they are always adjusting them up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntirely rural\nThe counties that are entirely rural but not recreational are experiencing the largest declines while the entirely rural - recreational are seeing some modest population gains.\nTown/rural mix\nTown rural mix counties that are not recreational are seeing some minor population declines while the recreational counties are experiencing very large population gains.\nUrban/town/rural mix\nUrban town rural mix counties that are not recreational are experiencing the second highest population gains at 17.8% while the counties that are recreational are seeing modest growth at 3.4%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, all of the planning regions have a higher population in 2023 than they did in 2000. The largest population growth has occurred in Central Minnesota with 30%, followed by the seven county metro with 19%. Southeast and Northwest have experienced population growth of a little over 10% while Northeast and Southwest are about even.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthwest\nAll EDRs are experiencing population growth except for EDR 1 which has lost 6.5% of it’s population since 2000.\nNortheast\nMinor population growth.\nCentral\nTremendous population growth in all EDRs except Southwest Central which is minimal at 2.2%.\nSouthwest\nEDR 9 is the only EDR with population growth at 6.7% more since 2000. EDR 6W and 8 are experiencing loss. EDR 6W in particular has lost 13.5% of it’s population since 2000.\nSoutheast\n13% growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map below shows that the population is lower in 2023 compared to 2000 for much of Southwest Minnesota, along the border in Northwest, and in the arrowhead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next question is whether one of the components of population change (natural vs. migration) is driving these trends. Let’s start with migration."

    "text": "Line charts\nThis first group is line charts indicating trends in the percentage of total population unit change that each component comprises. Each component would be positive, thus deaths and births each count equally as a unit of change.\nThe main theme is that deaths are becoming more prominent as a share of total population unit change. It’s surpassing births in our most rural areas. In addition, domestic migration is becoming less harmful in rural areas, and in some cases, is contributing positively to total population unit change.\n\nMinnesotaRUCARecreationalPlanning RegionEDRCounty\n\n\nThe chart below clearly shows that births has been and continues to be the largest contributor to total unit change in population. However, it is shrinking. There is significant growth in deaths as a share of total unit population change. Migration just isn’t that big of a piece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntirely rural\nBirths and deaths in our entirely rural counties have had a similar share of total unit change in population until about 2015. Since than, deaths has been increasing it’s share of total unit change.\nInterestingly, in the early 2000s, domestic migration was the largest contributor to total unit change in population with nearly 40% of individuals disappearing from those counties. That has improved significantly since that time frame.\nTown/rural mix\nBirths was the largest contribution to total unit change in population but has since given way to deaths as the largest share. Migration makes up a pretty small percentage of the total unit change.\nUrban/town/rural mix\nBirths made up nearly 50% of the entire unit change in population but that has decreased to 41%. Deaths has increased since that time frame. Domestic migration has gone up and down, but is now a positive share.\nEntirely urban\nBirths continue to make up a sizable share of total unit change in population. Deaths are increasing though while domestic migration continues to be burdensome as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntirely rural\nThe recreational counties have had the most significant share of their total population unit change from deaths and is currently 54% of the total change. however, births and domestic migration are also sizable.\nThe non-recreational counties have seen a large increase in births and deaths as a share of the total population unit change while domestic migration has been slowly becoming less bad.\nTown/rural mix\nThe recreational counties are experiencing death as a larger share of population unit change4 while births has declined. The domestic migration has increased significantly as well.\nFor non-recreational counties, births and death make up very similar shares of population change, while international migration has increased and the net out-domestic-migration has improved as well.\nUrban/town/rural mix\nIn recreational counties, deaths has stated about the same while births has declined as a share and domestic migration has increased.\nIn non-recreational counties, births continues to be a major driver in population unit change with death increasing. Domestic migration has improved since 2010 as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthwest, Central, Northeast\nThese planning regions are beginning to experience more deaths than births as a share of population unit change while domestic migration has improved significantly.\nSouthwest\nSouthwest has even births and deaths as a share of population change while international migration has increased and domestic migration has improved.\nSoutheast, Seven County Metro\nBoth regions have declining births as a share of population change while domestic migration has not been great. International migration continues to make up a sizable portion, however.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDR 1, 2, 4, 5\nThese EDRs have a similar pattern - births are beginning to break even with deaths as a share of population change. Domestic migration has either improved but still net out-migration (EDR 1) or are increasing the share towards positive population change (EDR 2, 4, 5).\nEDR 6E, 7w, 7E\nEDR 6E and 7E each have even births and deaths as a share of population change. 7E has significantly better migration numbers compared to 6E, although international migration has been very helpful for 6E.\nEDR 7W has significantly larger percentage of births. In the early 2000s, domestic migration was a huge driver but not has slowed a lot. Deaths are increasing significantly as a share of population change.\nEDR 6W, 8, 9\nAll three have a declining share of population change going towards births, and increasing deaths as a share of pop change. In addition, domestic migration continues to be a net out, but has improved. International migration contineus to be a larger share as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maps below show a few key themes;\n\nBirths are declining as a percentage of total population unit change.\nDeaths are increasing as a percentage of total population unit change.\nInternational migration makes up less than 25% of total population change across Minnesota.\nDomestic out-migration is becoming less severe across rural Minnesota while also changing to a net in-migration."

    "text": "Points made in the article\n\n“Some people did move, but not at a rate exceeding what had been typical before the pandemic.”\n\nI’m assuming the author means “some people did move”out of Minneapolis/metro”?“….\nI’m assuming rate here means the number of mover’s per x population (usually 100,000 people).\n\n“There’s other evidence that refutes the mass exodus. Renters signed leases on 4,800 apartments in the first half of 2024 — the most in a decade.”\n\nAre these new rentals or just turnover? People moving around within the metro?\nAlso, this is 2024 data. The article is trying to refute out migration during and immediately after the pandemic. It could be that the metro is finally recovering. It could be that college campuses are finally back at full capacity after having a lot of options for online learnings.\n\n“The Federal Reserve data shows that the majority of people — about 64% — who were living in Minneapolis in 2020 were still in the same place by 2023. That was just one percentage point lower than the share who stayed put between 2016 and 2019.”\n\nThis is great data. I was actually bit surprised that it’s only 64%. A lot of people move!\nI think the fact that the percentage of folks that didn’t move at all between 2020 and 2023 is nearly exactly that same as the percentage between 2016 and 2019 is really interesting.\nHowever, one thing to note with this is that this severely underrepresents individuals 25 and under. Families usually move together. This means that it’s worth checking to see if the type over movers changed at all. For example, what if the rate is the same, but the makeup of that rate is different - more families are moving rather than one-person households? The young kids would not be picked up in this data meaning it’s underrepresenting this movement.\n\n“Even Minneapolis residents who moved between 2020 and 2023 often didn’t go far. Of the people who did move, nearly 37% went to southwest Minneapolis or the Nokomis, Powderhorn or Northeast neighborhoods.”\n\nSo there were 36% of folks that had a residence in Minneapolis between 2016 and 2019 and ended up moving to a different residence between 2020 and 2023. Of these folks, 37% of them only went to a different neighborhood.\nWas this less or more than the previous three years?\n\n“those with high scores — above 750 — were most likely to stay in the metro and least likely to move to Greater Minnesota”\n\nHas this always been the case? And even if it’s least likely, did the rate change?\n\n“Among those living anywhere in the Twin Cities metro area, which is defined as a 16-county area, in 2020 just 1.8% left for Greater Minnesota by 2023, a number that is unchanged from the three-year period right before the pandemic”\n\nThis is interesting. However, did the number of people leaving increase? Because if so, that 1.8% is comparable to previous years. That’s just a rate. 1.8% of 10 people vs. 100 people is a very different value.\n\n“And while it takes more than a few extra numbers to break down years of misconceptions, Ellison said these findings matter to the people who have stayed in Minneapolis. “At minimum, it’s validating,” Ellison said. “And that matters to a city and to a population of people when there has been a considerable effort to demoralize us.”\n\nWelcome to our world in rural Minnesota."

    "text": "Points made in Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Report\nFirst, the name of the article is “Where are the Twin Cities area’s movers moving to?”. This is much different than the Minnesota Star Tribune article.\n\n“movement rates of the four credit score bands differ from one another, and also changed in different ways over time”\n\n“Throughout each period, people with credit scores of 750 and above remained the least likely to move. During the pandemic period, the gap in migration rates between people with the highest credit scores and people with the lowest shrank considerably. Higher-credit-score people’s migration rate was stable compared to the rate in prior periods, while lower-credit-score people’s migration rate decreased substantially.”\n\n“Our data allow us to estimate that 7.6 percent of the MSA’s people with a credit score left the region from 2020 to 2023, compared to 7.3 percent from 2016 to 2019. Larger shares of residents moved out of their census tract but in most cases stayed within the MSA.”\n“During the same time period, the number of people with a credit score moving from the MSA’s two central cities increased slightly. About 19 percent of the people living in Minneapolis in 2016 had moved to a suburb or left the MSA by 2019. From 2020 to 2023, about 21 percent of Minneapolitans did the same. The equivalent numbers for St. Paul were 17 and 18 percent for each time period, respectively.”\n“Tracts with lower shares of White people generally saw more movement from 2020 to 2023.”\n“A related pattern is visible in Figure 3, which shows that places with relatively low median household incomes tend to have substantially higher out-migration rates than places with relatively high median household incomes.”\n“more than three-quarters of the movers from low-income tracts moved to tracts in higher-income categories, and nearly half of the movers from moderate-income tracts moved to middle- or high-income tracts. Overall, one-third of the people who moved from 2020 through 2023 landed in a census tract within a higher income bracket than the one they started in.”\n\nOkay, so what the heck do we have here? The only data I have access to is the movers to different regions by credit score. And it’s only the percentage of population, not actual numbers. So I will use that.\nLet’s begin by looking at the percentage of the population within the MSA that move at all.\nThe chart below shows that overall individuals with a credit score between 580 and 650 tend to have higher rates of moving across all time frames. In addition, when looking at it by timeframes, it’s interesting that between 2016 and 2023, the percentage of individuals with the highest credit score saw a fairly significant increase in moving rates while the other credit scores saw a drop, particularly between 2020 and 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so next is to determine where they are moving. The chart below provides the percentage of MSA population that moved to different destinations by credit score. We are going to break up the comparisons because in the original report they actually use two different origins - movers either began in the MSA, or in the seven county metro.\nOrigin: MSA\nOverall, the highest rates of moving are individuals leaving the MSA for outside Minnesota. By 2023, 5.8% of this population left the MSA for another state compared to 3.4% that moved to another part of the MSA and 1.8% that moved to Greater MN.\nAcross all destinations, the highest rates of moving tended to be among individuals with mid-quality credit scores - 580 to 749.\nWhen looking across time frames within each destination, it’s interesting that both leaving MN, and leaving for Greater MN had increasing rates across all credit scores except for the very lowest. For example, individuals that left the MSA for Greater MN increased from 1.5% to 1.8%, however for the lowest credit score it decreased from 2.0% to 1.8%.\n\nOrigin: Seven county metro\nOverall, movers from the Seven county metro to another part of the Seven county metro are significantly higher than folks who leave the seven county metro for the greater MSA. For example, 2023, 16% of seven county metro dwellers moved to another part of the seven county metro, while only 1.2% moved outside of the seven county metro but within the MSA.\nAcross all destinations, the highest rates of moving was within the credit scores of 580 to 749.\nWhen looking across time frames within each destination, it’s interesting that the rate of individuals leaving the seven county metro to the greater MSA increased significantly across all credit scores except for the lowest. While the rate of individuals moving within the seven county metro has been decreasing across all credit scores."

    "text": "Points made in article\n\n“As measured by net migration to and from urban neighborhoods, 2020 does appear to have seen an urban exodus relative to the migration flows during the preceding 10 years (Figure 1).” (Whitaker, 2021, p. 2)\n“The net flow of people out of US urban neighborhoods averaged nearly 28,000 people per month in March through September of the recent years 2017 to 2019. That number about doubled—to 56,000 people per month—in 2020 after the pandemic’s onset in March.”\n“Figure 2 shows that the decline of in-migration is actually the larger driver. The average of monthly out-migration was 276,000 in March through September 2020. This is 10,000 more than its average of 266,000 for the same months in 2017 through 2019. The larger change was for in-migration, which fell 18,000—from an average of 238,000 in 2017 to 2019—to 220,000 in 2020.” (Whitaker, 2021, p. 4)\n“In most years, the net flows out of below-median-income neighborhoods are larger than the net flows out of above-median-income urban neighborhoods, but this pattern reversed in 2020. The net outflow of people who are purchasing a home at their destination neighborhood increased 62 percent, but the net outflow of those renting at their destination increased by 210 percent.” (Whitaker, 2021, p. 5)\n“By age category, young adults exhibited the largest increase in net outflows. The most populous metro areas, those with more than 5 million residents, saw larger increases in net outflows than did smaller metro areas” (Whitaker, 2021, p. 5)\n“Net out-migration was greater for metro areas that had more deaths from COVID-19 and those with more telework-capable occupations. Metro areas that had more small businesses remain open experienced less net out-migration. The increases in homicides in the metro area’s central city was not associated with increased net outmigration.” (Whitaker, 2021, p. 6)\nCities that experienced significant protests following the murder of George Floyd saw out-migration estimates that were twice as high as the average during the preceding three years. (Whitaker, p. 7)\n“The estimates presented here strongly suggest that migration flows were unfavorable for urban neighborhoods during 2020. However, the word “exodus” emphasizes that migrants are leaving a particular area in large numbers. If we look at the gross flows underlying the trends in Figures 3 through 6 (available in the appendix), we can see that the declines of in-migration are almost always greater than the increases in out-migration.” (Whitaker, 2021, p. 8)\n“What is certain is that hundreds of thousands of people who would have moved into an urban neighborhood in a typical year were unwilling or unable to do so in 2020.” (Whitaker, 2021, p. 8)\n\nThe big takeaway here is that it’s not necessarily about people “leaving”, but rather, a combination of fewer people moving into the twin cities while also a slight increase in the people moving out of the twin cities. This makes me think that if the out-flow migration was about the same as the previous years before the pandemic, it’s largely the lack of in-flow that impact the total net migration numbers in Hennepin and St. Paul. As Stephan Whitaker puts it;\n\n“What is certain is that hundreds of thousands of people who would have moved into an urban neighborhood in a typical year were unwilling or unable to do so in 2020.” (Whitaker, 2021, p. 8)"

    "section": "Updated numbers",
    "text": "Updated numbers\nSince this report in 2021, they have published updated numbers on the in-flows and out-flows of metropolitan areas.\n\n“In 2024:Q1, net outflows of migrants from urban neighborhoods, as measured by a four-quarter moving average, rose for the first time since mid-2021 (Figure 1), increasing from 113,800 to 116,900 per quarter.” (Whitaker, 2021, p. 1)\n“Net outflows accelerated in 8 of the 10 most populous urban centers, with notable increases in the San Francisco and Miami metro areas (Figure 2).” (Whitaker, 2021, p. 1)\n“A dozen metro areas have recently seen net urban migration above their prepandemic (2010–2019) trend lines.” (Whitaker, 2021, p. 1)\n\nSo, let’s see how Minneapolis is faring.\nIn the following charts, Minneapolis is defined as the Census Statistical Area - 19 counties along with 2 Wisconsin counties.\nThe chart below is the four quarter moving average of net migration for the Minneapolis CSA. The black line is the actual values of average migration, the blue line is the trend line from before the pandemic (before 2020-01-01) and the green line is the “recovery” line which starts on 2020-04-01. Before the pandemic, the trend line for the region was actually towards a net out-migration. When the pandemic hit there was actually a significant loss in net migration and since that time there’s been a recovery to their former trend line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, it’s important to remember that net migration is the sum of two different, opposing actions - people coming in minus the people that are leaving. It could be that one of these has changed more significantly than the other, such as very few people moving into the MSA while the number of people leaving has remained unchanged.\nAnd in fact, the author points this out in his 2021 article;\n\nAn increase in the net out-migration from urban neighborhoods can be driven either by an increase in people moving out or by a decrease in people moving in. Figure 2 shows that the decline of in-migration is actually the larger driver. The average of monthly out-migration was 276,000 in March through September 2020. This is 10,000 more than its average of 266,000 for the same months in 2017 through 2019. The larger change was for in-migration, which fell 18,000—from an average of 238,000 in 2017 to 2019—to 220,000 in 2020 (Whitaker, 2021)\n\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Bank of New York/Equifax Consumer Credit Panel, American Community Survey, and author’s calculations.\n\nThe following numbers represent the change in gross and net outflows from the Minneapolis-St.Paul-Bloomington CSA. The change is calculated as the difference between the flow in April to September 2020 from the average from the same months in 2017, 2018, and 2019.\nChange in Outflow: 9,000 migrants per month more than average leaving the metro\nChange in Inflow: -25,000 migrants per month more than average coming into the metro\nThere are two points to made here.\nFirst, there were signficant differences in both the inflows and outflows of migration in the Twin Cities metro CSA - there were 9,000 more people per month migrating out of the Twin Cities CSA compared to the 2017, 2018, and 2019 average. In addition, there were 25,000 LESS people per month migrating into the Twin Cities CSA compared to 2017, 2018, and 2019.\nSecond, the larger driver of the total net migration was actually that there were far LESS people moving into the Twin Cities Metro CSA.\nHere is the chart provided for the Twin Cities CSA that was in the report."
